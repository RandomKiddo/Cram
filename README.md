### About

Cram is a repository that attempts to implement multiple compression algorithms, both lossless and lossy, that span files like `.txt`, `.gif`, `.pdf`, etc. 

___

### Algorithms

This repository implements the following lossless algorithms: [Run Length](#run-length), [LZW](#lzw), and [Huffman](#huffman)

This repository implements the following lossy algorithms: [DFT](#dft) and [Wavelet](#wavelet)

##### Run Length

Run Length encoding uses the following system, and is a very simple text file compression method.

Simplify a line like `aaaabbcddddee` to `a4b2c1d4e2`

##### LZW

##### Huffman

##### DFT

##### Wavelet

___

### Sister Repository

This repository has a sister repository called Uncram that seeks to decompress the files compressed using these algorithms.
